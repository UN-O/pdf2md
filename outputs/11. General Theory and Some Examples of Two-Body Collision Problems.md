Title:**General Physics I Lecture Slide**


# (I) Center of Mass Motion of the Two-Body System 

1. Since the $3^{\text {rd }}$ law is about the interaction between two objects, different from the $1^{\text {st }}$ and $2^{\text {nd }}$ laws, we should consider two-body system with the equations of motion:
2. Adding them together, we find that the total external force can have lead to the following equation of motion of the center of mass position:
$\mathbf{F}_{\text {tot }}^{\text {ext }}=\mathbf{F}_{1}^{\text {ext }}+\mathbf{F}_{2 \rightarrow 1}^{\text {ext }}=\frac{d \mathbf{p}_{1}}{d t}\left(\mathbf{p}_{1}+\mathbf{p}_{2}\right) \equiv \frac{d}{d t} \mathbf{P}_{\text {tot }}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& =\frac{d}{d t}\left(m_{1} \mathbf{v}_{1}+m_{2} \mathbf{v}_{2}\right) \equiv M \frac{d}{d t} \mathbf{V}_{c} \quad M=m_{1}+m_{2} \\
& =\frac{d^{2}}{d t^{2}}\left(m_{1} \mathbf{r}_{1}+m_{2} \mathbf{r}_{2}\right) \equiv\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right) \frac{d^{2}}{d t^{2}} \mathbf{R}_{c}
\end{aligned}
$$

Here the Center of Mass Position, $\mathbf{R}_{c}$, and C.M. velocity can be defined as following:
$\mathbf{R}_{c} \equiv \frac{m_{1} \mathbf{r}_{1}+m_{2} \mathbf{r}_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}$
$\mathbf{V}_{c} \equiv \frac{d \mathbf{R}_{c}}{d t}=\frac{m_{1} \mathbf{v}_{1}+m_{2} \mathbf{v}_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}=\frac{\mathbf{P}_{\text {tot }}}{M}$
4. The advantage is: We can treat the whole system as a "single" particle with the mass $M=m_{1}+\mathrm{m}_{2}$, under the influence of a total external force, $\boldsymbol{F}_{\text {tot }}^{\text {ext }}$, without dealing with the effects of internal interactions.
![The diagram illustrates a two-body interaction where two masses, m1 and m2, are shown. Mass m1 is depicted with a force vector F21 pointing towards mass m2, and mass m2 has a force vector F12 pointing towards mass m1, indicating an interaction between the two. The velocities of the masses are represented by vectors v1 and v2, with v1 pointing upwards and v2 pointing downwards. A dashed line labeled Vc(t) represents the center of mass velocity trajectory. An inset equation in the top left corner shows the relationship 1/2 v2 = Ptot/M, describing the conservation of momentum in the system.](https://utfs.io/f/41f9cf1b-de99-4fd0-ae20-f68b04b67352-1nq5d3.jpeg) 
Title:**Two-Body Interaction with Momentum Conservation**


# (II) Relative Motion of Two-Body System 

1. However, the internal motion $\mathbf{r} \equiv \mathbf{r}_{1}-\mathbf{r}_{2}$ between these two particles can be still important. The way to investigate it is to study the relative part. For simplicity, we consider the case without external field, i.e.
$\mathbf{F}_{2 \rightarrow 1}=m_{1} \frac{d \mathbf{v}_{1}}{d t} \quad \mathbf{F}_{1 \rightarrow 2}=-\mathbf{F}_{2 \rightarrow 1}=m_{2} \frac{d \mathbf{v}_{2}}{d t}$
Therefore $\quad m_{2} \frac{d \mathbf{v}_{2}}{d t}=-m_{1} \frac{d \mathbf{v}_{1}}{d t}$
$\frac{d \mathbf{v}}{d t}=\frac{d}{d t}\left(\mathbf{v}_{1}-\mathbf{v}_{2}\right)=\left(1+\frac{m_{1}}{m_{2}}\right) \frac{d \mathbf{v}_{1}}{d t}=\frac{m_{1}}{\mu} \frac{d \mathbf{v}_{1}}{d t}$
$\mathbf{F}_{2 \rightarrow 1}=m_{1} \frac{d \mathbf{v}_{1}}{d t}=\mu \frac{d \mathbf{v}}{d t} \quad \mu \equiv \frac{m_{1} m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}$
2. An advantage is that we could separate the total kinetic energy into two parts for the C.M. and relative coordinates respectively.
3. We therefore could summarize that in general, the two-body system can be separated into two independent coordinates:
C.M. coordinate: $\quad \mathbf{F}_{\text {tot }}^{c e t}=M \frac{d^{2} \mathbf{R}_{c}}{d t^{2}}$
![The diagram illustrates the concept of center of mass (C.M.) coordinates in a two-particle system consisting of a proton (p⁺) and a helium nucleus (⁴He). The forces acting on the particles are denoted as Fₐₚ and Fₚₐ, indicating the interactions between the proton and helium nucleus. The system is enclosed in a dashed blue rectangle, representing the interaction region. An equation is provided at the top right, Fₜₒₜ^ₑₓₜ = M(d²X/dt²), indicating the total external force on the system, where M represents the combined mass of the two particles (M = m₁ + m₂).

Relative coordinate:
![The figure shows a section of a diagram featuring a blue arrow pointing to the right outside a black-bordered rectangle. Inside the rectangle, another blue arrow labeled 'r' points diagonally upwards towards an orange circular area labeled 'A'. This suggests a vector direction within the bounded space, potentially indicating movement or force towards point 'A'.](https://utfs.io/f/5f4c64fe-e6cf-43bf-921f-5c24fb20691f-1nq5d5.jpeg) 
Title:**Diagram of Vector Direction and Point of Interest**


$$
T_{C M}=\frac{M}{2} \mathbf{V}_{c}^{2}, \quad T_{r e l}=\frac{\mu}{2} \mathbf{v}^{2} \quad \mathbf{v} \equiv \mathbf{v}_{1}-\mathbf{v}_{2} \quad \mathbf{V}_{c} \equiv \frac{m_{1} \mathbf{v}_{1}+m_{2} \mathbf{v}_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}
$$

$$
T_{t o t}=\frac{m_{1}}{2} \mathbf{v}_{1}^{2}+\frac{m_{2}}{2} \mathbf{v}_{2}^{2}=\frac{M}{2} \mathbf{V}_{c}^{2}+\frac{\mu}{2} \mathbf{v}^{2}=T_{C M}+T_{r e l}
$$

# (III) Momentum and Conservation in Two-Body Collision Problems 

1. For simplicity, here we just consider the system without external force. The full two-body collision can be described by either of the following two pictures:
(1) Two-Body in Laboratory Coordinates:

$$
\mathbf{F}_{i n t}=m_{1} \frac{d \mathbf{v}_{1}}{d t} \quad-\mathbf{F}_{i n t}=m_{2} \frac{d \mathbf{v}_{2}}{d t}
$$

(2) C.M. and Relative Coordinates:

$$
\mathbf{F}_{i n t}^{e x t}=0=M \frac{d^{2} \mathbf{R}_{c}}{d t^{2}} \quad \mathbf{F}_{i n t}=\mu \frac{d^{2} \mathbf{r}}{d t^{2}}
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\mathbf{F}_{i n t}(|\mathbf{r}|) \equiv \mathbf{F}_{2 \rightarrow 1}\left(\left|\mathbf{r}_{1}-\mathbf{r}_{2}\right|\right) & \\
\mathbf{R}_{c} \equiv \frac{m_{1} \mathbf{r}_{1}+m_{2} \mathbf{r}_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}} & M \equiv m_{1}+m_{2} \\
\mathbf{r} \equiv \mathbf{r}_{1}-\mathbf{r}_{2} & \mu \equiv \frac{m_{1} m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}
\end{array}
$$

2. In principle, if we know the interaction form for the internal force, $\mathbf{F}_{\text {int }}$, we could solve the relative motion by setting the center of mass coordinate to be at origin. It can be understood as "scattering problem", and will be discussed in the future.
3. However, even if we do not know the details of interacting process, but just the results long time before and after interaction, we could still have some results available according to the conservation laws.
$0=M \frac{d^{2} \mathbf{R}_{c}}{d t^{2}}=M \frac{d \mathbf{V}_{c}}{d t} \Rightarrow \mathbf{V}_{c}=\frac{m_{1} \mathbf{v}_{1}+m_{2} \mathbf{v}_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}=$ const.
$\begin{aligned} & m_{1} \mathbf{v}_{1}^{i}+m_{2} \mathbf{v}_{2}^{i}=m_{1} \mathbf{v}_{1}^{f}+m_{2} \mathbf{v}_{2}^{f} \\ & m_{1} \mathbf{v}_{1}^{f}-m_{1} \mathbf{v}_{1}^{i}=\Delta \mathbf{p}_{1}=-\Delta \mathbf{p}_{2}=-\left(m_{2} \mathbf{v}_{2}^{f}-m_{2} \mathbf{v}_{2}^{i}\right)\end{aligned}$
Note that, above result is based on two laws:
(1) by the $2^{\text {nd }}$ law with $\mathbf{F}_{i o t}^{e x t}=0$, and
(2) by the $3^{\text {rd }}$ law with $\mathbf{F}_{1 \rightarrow 2}=\mathbf{F}_{2 \rightarrow 1}$.

# (IV) Energy Conservation in Two-Body Interacting Problem 

1. For energy conservation, however, it is not that straightforward as the momentum conservation, depending on the work done by the internal force during the collision.

$$
\begin{aligned}
W_{i n t}^{i \rightarrow f} & =\int_{i}^{f} \mathbf{F}_{i n t} \cdot d \mathbf{r}=\mu \int_{i}^{f} \frac{d \mathbf{v}}{d t} \cdot d \mathbf{r} \\
& =\mu \int_{i}^{f} \mathbf{v} \cdot d \mathbf{v}=\frac{\mu}{2}\left[\left(\mathbf{v}^{f}\right)^{2}-\left(\mathbf{v}^{i}\right)^{2}\right] \\
T_{r e l}^{f}-T_{r e l}^{i} & =\frac{\mu}{2}\left(\mathbf{v}^{f}\right)^{2}-\frac{\mu}{2}\left(\mathbf{v}^{i}\right)^{2}=W_{i n t}^{i \rightarrow f}
\end{aligned}
$$

2. On the other hand, we could also separate the internal force to be a conservative one and a nonconservative one (friction), so that the work can be obtained to be

$$
\begin{aligned}
W_{i n t}^{i \rightarrow f} & =\int_{i}^{f} \mathbf{F}_{i n t} \cdot d \mathbf{r}=\int_{i}^{f}\left(\mathbf{F}_{c o n}+\mathbf{f}_{k}\right) \cdot d \mathbf{r} \\
& =\left(-U_{r e l}^{f}\right)-\left(-U_{r e l}^{i}\right)-H_{i n t}^{i \rightarrow f}
\end{aligned}
$$

3. Combine the above two results together, we find the following general form of energy conservation during the two-body collision:

$$
\begin{gathered}
W_{i n t}^{i \rightarrow f}=T_{r e l}^{f}-T_{r e l}^{i}=\left(-U_{r e l}^{f}\right)-\left(-U_{r e l}^{i}\right)-H_{i n t}^{i \rightarrow f} \\
\underbrace{T_{r e l}^{f}+U_{i n t}^{f}}_{\equiv E_{l o t}^{f}}=\underbrace{T_{r e l}^{i}+U_{i n t}^{i}-H_{i n t}^{i \rightarrow f}}_{\equiv E_{l o t}^{i}}
\end{gathered}
$$

Note that, this is true even for the system with an external field, because this is related to relative coordinate only.
4. The total energy of the CM motion should be calculated separately from $\quad \mathbf{F}_{\text {tot }}^{\text {ext }}=M d \mathbf{V}_{c} / d t$

$$
\Rightarrow T_{C M}^{f}-T_{C M}^{i}=\frac{M}{2}\left(\mathbf{V}_{c}^{f}\right)^{2}-\frac{M}{2}\left(\mathbf{V}_{c}^{i}\right)^{2}=W_{e x t}^{i \rightarrow f}
$$

Again, we could also separate the work done by the external force to be a conservative one ( $\rightarrow$ become potential energy) and the one by friction, but not show them here to avoid confusion.

# (V) Several Special Cases to Study 

1. Case I (Elastic Scattering) :

![The equation displayed on a bright yellow background represents a fundamental relation in mechanics or thermodynamics. It expresses the equivalence between the final and initial states of a system. The terms on the left, T^f_rel and U^f_int, represent the final relative kinetic energy and the final internal potential energy, respectively, with their sum denoted as E^f. The right side of the equation includes T^i_rel and U^i_int, which denote the initial relative kinetic energy and the initial internal potential energy, respectively, summed as E^i. The equation balances these energies by accounting for an energy transfer term, H^i→f_int, which represents the energy lost or gained during the transition from the initial to the final state.](https://utfs.io/f/31a65e66-a2ba-4476-8ec0-1395f644139d-1nq5d6.jpeg) 
Title:**Energy Balance Equation in Mechanics/Thermodynamics**

Internal potential is unchanged. No heat is generated.
$\rightarrow$ The total relative Kinetic Energy is also conserved)

$$
U_{\text {int }}^{f}=U_{\text {int }}^{i} \quad H_{\text {int }}^{i \rightarrow f}=0 \quad T_{r e l}^{f}=T_{r e l}^{i}
$$

![The image depicts a diagram with two identical sections. Each section features a blue circle labeled 'A' connected by black arrows to a gray square labeled 'B'. The arrows point from 'A' to 'B' and vice versa, indicating a bidirectional relationship or interaction between the two elements.](https://utfs.io/f/8bd66ab8-61da-4ad0-9c86-67484ae7cfbd-1nq5d7.jpeg)

2. Case II (Perfect Inelastic Scattering without potential change) :

Internal potential is unchanged. Heat is generated. Final velocities are the same $\rightarrow$ The total relative Kinetic Energy is not conserved

$$
U_{\text {int }}^{f}=U_{\text {int }}^{i} \quad H_{\text {int }}^{i \rightarrow f} \neq 0 \quad T_{r e l}^{f}=T_{r e l}^{i}-H_{\text {int }}^{i \rightarrow f}
$$

![The diagram shows a process where an entity labeled 'A' is represented by a blue circle. It is connected by black arrows with solid lines to another section of the diagram, where a blue circle labeled 'A' is adjacent to a gray square labeled 'B'.

3. Case III (Inelastic Scattering with potential change) :

Internal potential is changed. No heat is generated.
$\rightarrow$ The total relative Kinetic Energy is not conserved

$$
U_{\text {int }}^{f} \neq U_{\text {int }}^{i} \quad H_{\text {int }}^{i \rightarrow f}=0 \quad T_{r e l}^{f}=T_{r e l}^{i}-\underbrace{\left(U_{\text {int }}^{f}-U_{\text {int }}^{i}\right)}_{\Delta U_{\text {int }}}
$$

Node A is a blue circle, and it has an arrow pointing towards node B, which is a gray square. Node A also has an arrow pointing towards node X, a dark green circle with a purple outline. Node B is connected to node B', a blue square, via a directed arrow. Node X also has an arrow pointing towards node B'.

# (VI) Conservation of Momentum and Energy in the Laboratory Frame 

1. Although we have separate the two-body coordinates in to the C.M. frame and relative frame to make the physics clearer, it is still more convenient to reexpress it in the laboratory (observer's) frame, because physical quantities can be measured directly.
2. For simplicity, we just consider the situation without external force, so that the kinetic energy is conserved in the C.M. Frame, i.e.

$$
T_{C M}^{f}=\bar{T}_{C M}^{i} \Rightarrow \frac{M}{2}\left(\mathbf{V}_{c}^{f}\right)^{2}=\frac{M}{2}\left(\mathbf{V}_{c}^{i}\right)^{2}
$$

3. Using the results in the relative frame,
![The figure illustrates a derivation process in classical mechanics using the relative frame results and a known identity. The top equation shows: \( T_{rel}^f + U_{int}^f = T_{rel}^i + U_{int}^i - H_{int}^{i \to f} \). Below, a known mechanical identity is presented: \( T_{tot} = \frac{m_1}{2}v_1^2 + \frac{m_2}{2}v_2^2 = \frac{M}{2}V_c^2 + \frac{\mu}{2}v^2 = T_{CM} + T_{rel} \). Finally, the derived equation is shown: \( T_{tot}^f + U_{int}^f \equiv E_{lab}^f = T_{tot} + U_{int}^i - H_{int}^{i \to f} \equiv \bar{E}_{lab}^i \). The arrows indicate the logical flow from the initial expressions to the final derived equation.](https://utfs.io/f/edd47599-4dde-4147-a0a5-4509333913b6-1nq5da.jpeg) 
Title:**Equation Derivation in Relative Frame**

4. Therefore, in the laboratory frame without external forces, the conservation of total energy leads to

$$
\begin{aligned}
T_{t o t}^{f}+U_{i n t}^{f} & =\frac{m_{1}}{2}\left(\mathbf{v}_{1}^{f}\right)^{2}+\frac{m_{2}}{2}\left(\mathbf{v}_{2}^{f}\right)^{2}+U_{i n t}^{f} \\
& =\frac{m_{1}}{2}\left(\mathbf{v}_{1}^{i}\right)^{2}+\frac{m_{2}}{2}\left(\mathbf{v}_{2}^{i}\right)^{2}+U_{i n t}^{i}-H_{i n t}^{i \rightarrow f} \\
& =T_{t o t}^{i}+U_{i n t}^{i}-H_{i n t}^{i \rightarrow f}
\end{aligned}
$$

5. In the laboratory frame without external forces, the conservation of total momentum is
$M \mathbf{V}_{c}^{f}=M \mathbf{V}_{c}^{i} \Rightarrow m_{1} \mathbf{v}_{1}^{f}+m_{2} \mathbf{v}_{2}^{f}=m_{1} \mathbf{v}_{1}^{i}+m_{2} \mathbf{v}_{2}^{i}$
6. In the textbook or many other books, one may use different index position, say $\mathbf{v}_{1}^{i} \rightarrow \mathbf{v}_{1 i} \quad \mathbf{v}_{1}^{f} \rightarrow \mathbf{v}_{1 f}$
$\frac{m_{1}}{2} \mathbf{v}_{1 f}^{2}+\frac{m_{2}}{2} \mathbf{v}_{2 f}^{2}+U_{i n t}^{f}=\frac{m_{1}}{2} \mathbf{v}_{1 i}^{2}+\frac{m_{2}}{2} \mathbf{v}_{2 i}^{2}+U_{i n t}^{i}-H_{i n t}^{i \rightarrow f}$
$m_{1} \mathbf{v}_{1 f}+m_{2} \mathbf{v}_{2 f}=m_{1} \mathbf{v}_{1 i}+m_{2} \mathbf{v}_{2 i}$

# (VII) Special Case I: Elastic Collision in 1D 

1. Considering 1D motion first, we could have the following equations immediately $\left(U_{\text {int }}^{i / f}=H_{\text {int }}^{i / f}=0\right)$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& m_{1} v_{1 f}+m_{2} v_{2 f}=m_{1} v_{1 i}+m_{2} v_{2 i} \\
& \frac{m_{1}}{2} v_{1 f}^{2}+\frac{m_{2}}{2} v_{2 f}^{2}=\frac{m_{1}}{2} v_{1 i}^{2}+\frac{m_{2}}{2} v_{2 i}^{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

2. There are two equations for the two unknown answers: $v_{1 f}$ and $v_{2 f}$, the solution is shown to be (see the Ch 9 of the textbook for more details)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v_{1 f}=\left(\frac{m_{1}-m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}\right) v_{1 i}+\left(\frac{2 m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}\right) v_{2 i} \\
& v_{2 f}=\left(\frac{2 m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}\right) v_{1 i}+\left(\frac{m_{2}-m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}\right) v_{2 i}
\end{aligned}
$$

The blue sphere is on the left, and the orange sphere is on the right. Above each sphere, there is a green rectangle containing a mathematical expression. The expression for the blue sphere is '(m1 | m2)', and for the orange sphere, it is '(m1 | m2)'. These expressions suggest a comparison or relationship between two masses, m1 and m2, possibly in the context of a physics problem involving motion or collisions.](https://utfs.io/f/4b7b6d62-f102-4a6a-8ab0-206f40c9e82d-1nq5db.jpeg)

$$

& v_{1 f}=v_{2 i} \\
& v_{2 f}=v_{1 i}
\end{aligned}
$$

![The figure illustrates the concept of exchanging velocities in a system similar to Newton's cradle. On the left, two balls are shown with the notation 'v1f = v2i' and 'v2f = v1i', indicating that the final velocity of the first ball equals the initial velocity of the second ball, and vice versa. Below this, an oval label reads 'Exchange velocities'. Two diagrams depict the motion: on the left, a single ball is in motion towards a group of stationary balls, while on the right, a group of balls is moving to the right. Red arrows indicate the direction of movement in both diagrams.](https://utfs.io/f/ebf31086-8a42-4891-982a-646bd279c786-jllfo7.jpeg)

$$
\begin{aligned}
& v_{1 f} \approx v_{1 i} \\
& v_{2 f} \approx 2 v_{1 i}-v_{2 i}
\end{aligned}
$$

The heavier does not change velocity, but the lighter change its velocity significantly

The motorcycle is shown on the left, with a distinct orange fuel tank and a classic design. On the right, a white truck is depicted, highlighting its larger size. The text overlay suggests that while the truck has a higher mass, it does not significantly change its velocity compared to the motorcycle, which is lighter and thus experiences a more noticeable change in velocity. The formula 'v1i - v2i' is presented in the top left, indicating the initial velocities of the two vehicles.](https://utfs.io/f/ebca0f8d-dff5-46c1-8ba5-b3b8a796ce14-jllfo6.jpeg)

# (VIII) Special Case I: Elastic Collision in 2D or 3D 

1. The angular momentum conservation makes sure that the scattering in 3D without an external force must be within a 2D plane. We could see this from the equation of the motion:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathbf{L}=\mu \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{v} \quad \mathbf{F}_{\text {int }}(|\mathbf{r}|)=F_{\text {int }}(r) \hat{\mathbf{r}}=\mu \frac{d \mathbf{v}}{d t} \\
& \Rightarrow \frac{d}{d t} \mathbf{L}=\mu \frac{d \mathbf{r}}{d t} \times \mathbf{v}+\mu \mathbf{r} \times \frac{d \mathbf{v}}{d t}=\mu \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{v}+\mathbf{r} \times F(r) \hat{\mathbf{r}}=0
\end{aligned}
$$

Title:**Particle Trajectory and Closest Approach**

2. In general, there will 4 quantities $\left(v_{1 f}, v_{2 f}, \theta, \varphi\right)$ to be determined but only three equations from conservational law, i.e. no unique solution and one has to know the interaction or at least one of the observational results.
$m_{1} v_{1 f} \sin \theta+m_{2} v_{2 f} \sin \phi=0$
$m_{1} v_{1 f} \cos \theta+m_{2} v_{2 f} \cos \phi=m_{1} v_{1 i}+m_{2} v_{2 i}$
$\frac{m_{1}}{2} v_{1 f}^{2}+\frac{m_{2}}{2} v_{2 f}^{2}=\frac{m_{1}}{2} v_{1 i}^{2}+\frac{m_{2}}{2} v_{2 i}^{2}$

# (IX) Special Case II: Perfect Inelastic Collision 

1. For this inelastic collision, we have $\mathbf{v}_{1 f}=\mathbf{v}_{2 f}=\mathbf{v}_{f}$ and $H_{\text {int }}^{i / f} \neq 0$

$$
\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right) \mathbf{v}_{f}=m_{1} \mathbf{v}_{1 i}+m_{2} \mathbf{v}_{2 i}
$$

$\frac{1}{2}\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right) \mathbf{v}_{f}^{2}=\frac{m_{1}}{2} \mathbf{v}_{1 i}^{2}+\frac{m_{2}}{2} \mathbf{v}_{2 i}^{2}-H_{i n t}^{i \rightarrow f}$
2. We can see that the momentum conservation could determine the final

The initial kinetic energy, \( H^{i \to f}_{int} \), is depicted as the sum of the initial energies of both masses minus the final kinetic energy, expressed as \( \frac{1}{2} (m_1 + m_2) v_f^2 \). There is a note indicating that the heat generated by the collision due to friction is not considered in this problem. A visual representation shows a bullet of mass m1 traveling with velocity \( \vec{v}_{1A} \) impacting a block of mass m2, both hanging from strings. The block and bullet move together with velocity \( \vec{v}_B \) after the collision. Another note states that the height is determined by the final total kinetic energy after the collision.](https://utfs.io/f/fa9eb8de-c080-46f8-a589-870580c228e4-jllfo2.jpeg)

# (X) Special Case III: Inelastic Collision due to the Internal Potential Change in 1D 

1. For this inelastic collision, we have internal potential change, so that $\boldsymbol{U}_{\text {int }}^{\boldsymbol{f}} \neq \boldsymbol{U}_{\text {int }}^{\boldsymbol{i}}$. Assuming no friction of heat generation.

& \frac{1}{2}\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\right) \mathbf{v}_{f}^{2}=\frac{m_{1}}{2} \mathbf{v}_{1 i}^{2}+\frac{m_{2}}{2} \mathbf{v}_{2 i}^{2}-\Delta U_{i n t}

![The diagram illustrates a two-mass spring system consisting of two blocks with masses labeled as m1 and m2. Mass m1 is depicted as a beige block on the left and mass m2 as a blue block on the right. Both masses are connected by a spring with spring constant k, represented by a coiled line between the masses. The system is positioned on a flat surface, and red arrows indicate the direction of motion: one arrow points to the right from m1, another points to the left from m2, and a horizontal arrow points to the right below the system, suggesting external forces or motion directions.](https://utfs.io/f/d2a18ab1-de91-4f83-a61a-801f56ecbb4d-jllfo1.jpeg)

![The diagram illustrates the process of fluorescence in atomic energy states. On the left, a graph depicts the transition of an atom from the ground state to excited state levels, initiated by absorbed excitation light (blue arrow), leading to a higher energy state. The energy is indicated on the vertical axis. The excited state is unstable, resulting in the emission of fluorescent light (red arrow), as the atom returns to the ground state, depicted as the 'fluorescence lifetime' in nanoseconds. On the right, a sequence of circles represents the atomic transition, starting with a photon (光子) interacting with an atom (原子), transitioning into a high energy state (高能量狀態) before returning to its original state, emitting light. The process is labeled as fluorescence (螢光) in the yellow oval.](https://utfs.io/f/ffe7e5da-02ed-40ce-9844-cd045f8f80a3-jllfo0.jpeg)

# (XI) Rocket Equation 

1. For a rocket flying in the space without gravity, it is accelerated by ejecting its fuel through explosion. Assuming the total mass is M and the initial velocity is $v$, the fuel of mass $\Delta m$ is ejected from the body of rocket with a relative velocity $v_{e}$.

Initial momentum: $\quad \mathbf{p}_{i}=M \mathbf{v}$
Final momentum: $\quad \mathbf{p}_{f}=(M-\Delta m)(\mathbf{v}+\Delta \mathbf{v})+\Delta m\left(\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{v}_{e}\right)$
Momentum conservation $\rightarrow M \mathbf{v}=(M-\Delta m)(\mathbf{v}+\Delta \mathbf{v})+\Delta m\left(\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{v}_{e}\right)$

The missile is oriented with its nose facing right, and its rear features propulsion nozzles. An arrow labeled 'V' with a vector symbol above it, positioned in the top right of the image, indicates the direction of velocity towards the right, represented by a bold red arrow.](https://utfs.io/f/7d93818c-e030-441d-9e87-c3c12d04bae1-jllfnz.jpeg)

$$
0=M \Delta \mathbf{v}-\Delta m \mathbf{v}_{e}+O\left(\Delta^{2}\right)
$$

$$
\frac{\Delta \mathbf{v}}{\mathbf{v}_{e}}=\frac{\Delta m}{M}=-\frac{\Delta M}{M}
$$

$$
\text { because } \Delta M=-\Delta m<0
$$

$$
\int_{\mathbf{v}_{i}}^{\mathbf{v}_{f}} \frac{d \mathbf{v}}{\mathbf{v}_{e}}=-\int_{M_{i}}^{M_{f}} \frac{\Delta M}{M}
$$

That is why it is the most challenging part to send human beings to the Mars. They cannot return unless one could generate enough fuel for the return rocket on the Mars itself.
